## Hi there 👋

I’m Ameya, currently diving into AI Engineering with a focus on building autonomous systems that learn and adapt in real-time. Designing intelligent technologies is my passion.

📊 With a background in Data Analysis, I excel at transforming complex datasets into compelling visualizations that drive actionable insights. I love turning raw numbers into impactful visuals through data storytelling.

🤖 I’m fascinated by Deep Learning and Neural Networks, creating sophisticated algorithms that mimic cognitive processes and push the boundaries of machine learning.

🎮 Reinforcement Learning is another area I’m passionate about, exploring how agents can learn optimal behaviors through interactions with their environment, advancing autonomous decision-making and dynamic problem-solving.

🧠 Dedicated to developing 'brains' for autonomous systems, I integrate cutting-edge techniques to create self-learning machines that operate independently and efficiently.
